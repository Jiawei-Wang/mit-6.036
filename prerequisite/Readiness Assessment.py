1.1) Row and column vectors

Two vectors:
a = [1 2 3]
b = [4 5 6]


To add two equal length vectors, we simply add the corresponding elements in each vector to produce a new same-length vector.
a + b = [5 7 9]
a + 10b = [41 52 63]

We multiply each element in the first vector by the corresponding element in the second vector, producing the same-size result vector.
a * b = [4 10 18]

a row vector and a column vector cannot be added together


1.2) Vector dot product
a â‹… b = 32
The dot product is the sum of the element-wise product of the two vectors


1.3) 2d arrays and matrices
